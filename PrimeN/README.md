# Random Access Machine - Find the Prime number

## Introduction

This is a small algorithm, written in RAM, which can make it clear if a number is a prime number or not.

## Requirements

[Download](https://arbeitsplattform.bildung.hessen.de/fach/informatik/remasp.zip) the remasp Simulator

## How it works

Run the Remasp.jar and then copy and paste this code there. 

Finding out if the number is a prime number:

At the first line, after the "#" insert the number you want to check.
Then start the program.

* if the Register 3 is equal to 1, then the number is a prime number
* if the Register 3 is NOT equal to 1, then the number is NOT a prime number
